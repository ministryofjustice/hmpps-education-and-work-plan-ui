The Induction, previously known as the "CIAG Induction", is performed soon after the prisoner enters prison, and it's
purpose is to collect background information about the prisoner, their education, skills and interests, and their
future work aspirations.

The Induction data is presented and collected using a typical GDS wizard style sequence of screens, where the answers to
questions will determine the question set. Broadly speaking there is a long question for when the prisoner wants to work
on release and a short question set for when they do not (or are not sure). There are some additional subtleties within
these 2 question sets based on the answers to questions, but in general the terms "short question set" and 
"long question set" are used.
